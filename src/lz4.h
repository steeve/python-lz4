/*
LZ4_compressCtx() :
	This function explicitly handles the CTX memory structure.
	It avoids allocating/deallocating memory between each call, improving performance when malloc is heavily invoked.
	This function is only useful when memory is allocated into the heap (HASH_LOG value beyond STACK_LIMIT)
	Performance difference will be noticeable only when repetitively calling the compression function over many small segments.
	Note : by default, memory is allocated into the stack, therefore "malloc" is not invoked.
LZ4_compress64kCtx() :
	Same as LZ4_compressCtx(), but specific to small inputs (<64KB).
	isize *Must* be <64KB, otherwise the output will be corrupted.

	On first call : provide a *ctx=NULL; It will be automatically allocated.
	On next calls : reuse the same ctx pointer.
	Use different pointers for different threads when doing multi-threading.
